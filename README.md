# openvas-check-setup
openvas-check-setup script adapted for Alpine Linux.

It's basically a fork of the nice job done here ```https://github.com/Atomicorp/gvm/blob/master/src/gvm/openvas-check-setup```, but for Alpine.

Alpine Linux doesn't use ```bash``` but ```busybox ash```, which is POSIX compliant.
